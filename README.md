Dear community,

There's something missing in Web3. We've built all these complex financial widgets in DeFi. But for the vast majority of people, the most visible and trusted financial institution in the world is not a broker or an exchange or a hedge fund. It's a local bank.

DAOs are the native companies of Web3, but there's a marked lack of "small business DAOs". If we want Web3 to scale to the rest of society, then we need to support more mom-and-pop DAOs. We need to help normal people launch small businesses like restaurants, shops, hotels, events, and consultancies.

**We need a bank for DAOs.**

I'm starting that bank. It'll give out dead simple, fixed rate loans either unsecured or backed by whatever form of collateral that normal people actually have access to. And I'm going to build it this week, during ETH Denver 2024.

Want to learn more or help? For now, I'm just sharing the working doc with a small group. But I'd love to build this bank with the community, for the community. So if you have a tip or a question (or want to sign up for a loan), just [DM me](https://x.com/joshuaztan) or join [this TG group](https://t.me/+jqj7uPccAwVhMGUx) to stay in touch.

Warmly,\
Josh
