# A Bank for DAOs

Dear community,

There's something missing in Web3. We've built all these complex financial widgets in DeFi. But for the vast majority of people, the most visible and trusted financial institution in the world is not a broker or an exchange or a hedge fund. It's a local bank.

Banks serve small businesses, but where are all the small businesses in Web3? If we want Web3 to scale to the rest of society, then we need to support more mom-and-pop DAOs. We need to help normal people launch small businesses like restaurants, shops, event management companies, and consultancies.

**We need a bank for DAOs.**

I'm starting that bank. It'll give out dead simple, fixed rate loans backed by whatever form of collateral that normal people actually have access to. It's a community bank for DAOs. And I'm going to build it this week, during ETH Denver 2024.
