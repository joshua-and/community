# A Bank for DAOs

Dear community,

There's something missing in Web3. We've built all this complex financial infrastructure in DeFi. But the most visible financial infrastructure in the world is not an exchange or a hedge fund. It's a local community bank.

If we want Web3 to scale to the rest of society, then we need to support more mom-and-pop DAOs. We need to help normal people launch small businesses like restaurants, shops, event management companies, and consultancies.

**We need a bank for DAOs.**

I'm starting that bank. It'll give out dead simple, fixed rate loans backed by whatever form of collateral that normal people actually have access to. It's a community bank for DAOs. And I'm going to build it this week, during ETH Denver 2024.

Warmly,
Josh
